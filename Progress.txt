Problem Statement: 
	Player Attribute Analysis and Recruitment Strategy for Real Madrid CF.
Real Madrid CF, one of the world's premier football clubs, is strategically planning to bolster its squad following the recent departure of key players. The club's objective is to make 
three targeted signings for the striker, central attacking midfielder (CAM), and left-wing (LW) positions to reinforce squad depth and sustain its competitive edge. A budget of 200 
million Euros has been allocated for these acquisitions.

Modified Approach:

	Prior to finalizing player acquisitions, the club aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of player attributes and career trends using Power BI visualizations. The key areas of 
analysis include. 

	Player Performance Trends: We will delve into individual player data to identify trends related to player performance for each of the three positionsâ€”striker, CAM, and LW. This 
	analysis will reveal the age range during which players typically reach the pinnacle of their careers in these positions.

	Key Positional Attributes: We will determine the critical attributes that significantly influence player success in these roles. This analysis will help prioritize attributes such 
	as shooting accuracy, passing ability, dribbling skills, defensive capabilities, and more.

	Development Trajectories: By comparing players' current ratings with their potential ratings, we can assess their development trajectories. This evaluation will aid in identifying 
	young talents who have the potential to become top-performing players.

	Budget Optimization: We will evaluate players not only based on their skillset but also considering their market value, wage demands, and potential return on investment. This will 
	ensure that player acquisitions align with Real Madrid CF's financial constraints.

	Strategic Recruitment: Along with data-driven insights into ideal player attributes and career trends, the club will strategically recruit young talents aged 25 or younger(subject 
	ot the detailed analysis of the trends and statistics), with an overall rating of at least 70 and a potential rating of at least 80. These players are expected to make an 
	immediate impact on the team's performance while ensuring budget adherence.

	By conducting this thorough analysis of player attributes and career trends, Real Madrid CF aims to make informed and strategic recruitment decisions that not only fulfill positional 
requirements but also align with the club's long-term objectives. This data-driven approach ensures that the selected players not only meet performance criteria but also possess attributes 
that complement the team's style of play and future aspirations.

Process:  

	1. Originally, I planned to do the data cleaning in MySQL. But when I tried to import the csv file to mysql, it was taking long time
to get imported. Then I decided to clean the data a bit in excel itself to reduce the import time. 
	
	2. The "date of joining the current club" column was given in string format. I converted them into proper date format by using the following 
formula: 
	=DATE(RIGHT(V1,4),MATCH(LEFT(V1,3),{"Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"},0),MID(V1,FIND(" ",V1)+1,FIND(",",V1)-FIND(" ",V1)-1))

	3. Then there were players value, release clause and wages columns, which were given in string format too with millions and thousands euros. 
I have changed them to proper number format(to ease up the importing process) keeping the amount of price intact. I used the following formula for this:
	 =IF(RIGHT(M2, 1)="K", SUBSTITUTE(M2, "K", "")*1000, IF(RIGHT(M2, 1)="M", SUBSTITUTE(M2, "M", "")*1000000, M2))

	4. Importing the csv file to mysql: As there are more than 18000 records in the file, I choose to upload the file through 
command prompt command to make it quick. I actually tried to upload the file with the help of import table wizard option in mysql. 
It was taking a lot of time. However when I used command prompt, it took only a few seconds to load the full data. I used the following 
method to import the file: 

	cd (mysql bin directory path);
	mysql - u root -p;
	(enter password)
        SET GLOBAL local_infile =1;
	quit;
	mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
	(enter password);
	LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'file location on your system'
	INTO TABLE Players
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
	ENCLOSED BY '"'
	LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	IGNORE 1 LINES; 

*Note: While trying to upload the file it was showing errors like: ERROR 1300 (HY000): Invalid utf8mb4 character string: 'FC Bayern M' as there are some special characters that were not
supported by mysql. So I changed the encoding of the file to utf-8. Then the error was resolved.
